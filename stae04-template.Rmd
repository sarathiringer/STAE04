# R Markdown

This document is written using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). R Markdown
is a syntax for formatting documents that lets you focus on the 
content instead of formatting. You write text, including code, in R Markdown syntax
and then R Markdown (plus a handful of very useful packages) turn that text into
a neatly formatted document.

This document serves as both a template for your submissions during the data visualization
course as well as an introduction into R Markdown. To follow along, you should load
this file in RStudio. 

## Installation

To get started, you are going to need two
packages: **rmarkdown** and **knitr**.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "knitr"))
```

You will also need a distribution of LaTeX. Installing LaTeX can be a little 
involved, but it is fortunately very easy to install a lightweight LaTeX distribution
using the **tinytex** package (if you don't already have a distribution), like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

## YAML

A R Markdown file ends with `.Rmd` and is best edited using RStudio. Each Rmarkdown file
starts with a so called YAML block; here is a bare-bones one:

```yaml
---
title: "An Awesome Title"
author: "Fantastic Me"
date: "2020-09-28"
output: pdf_document
---
```

For this course, you will not need to
change anything in the YAML block other than the `author`, `date`, and `title` fields.

## Formatting

Rmarkdown uses [Pandoc markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown)
for formatting text, which uses a special---but very simple---syntax for formatting
text. The following are some ways in which you can format text in R Markdown.

Start a new paragraph by surrounding text with blank lines.

*Single asterisks italicize text*, **double asterisks format text in bold**, and
`grave accents formats text in monospace`.

To create lists in markdown, you add a 

- dash before each item in the list, and
  * possibly asterisks for sub-items in the list,
- placing items each on its own line, and
- adding blank lines before and after the list.

Numbered lists are 

1. created similarly, but
2. using numbers instead of dashes.

Sections are created by prefacing the section title with a hash tag (`#`):

```markdown
# One Hashtag Creates a Section

## Two Hashtags Creates a Subsection

### Three Hastags Creates a Subsubsection
```

R Markdown can do quotation formatting too!

  creates a block quote ---Johan Larsson
  
There are [many ways](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL#tables) to format tables in markdown,
but the simplest one is two simply create columns of text with dahes `---` separating
the title of each column from the cells of the table.

Header 1    Header 2
---------   ---------
Cell 1      Cell 2
Cell 3      Cell 4

To add a link in markdown, you can either simply surround the URL with
brackets like this link to a R Markdown 
cheatsheet: <https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf>
or you can use brackets and 
parantheses to provide your own 
[text for the link](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).

Images can be added with syntax similar to the one for links, with the
text inside brackets indicating the caption for the figure.

![Here is Charle's Minard famous Napoleon chart, for instance. (Public domain.)](images/napoleon.png)

Sometimes it is useful to provide footnotes^[If the footnote is short, it is often
best to write it in-line, like this.]. For a longer footnote, it might be better to
refer to it with a number[^1].

[^1]: Then you can add your text separately in the document.

It is also possible to add citations in R Markdown but this is somewhat complicated if
you are not familiar with markdown, pandoc, or LaTeX since before. In this course you
will usually never need more than one or two citations, so we suggest you write the
citations manually, which means you can skip the next paragraph (unless you are keen on 
getting deeper into R Markdown and pandoc).

You will need a `.bib` file in your working directory or a sub-directory of it. This
file should contain bibtex-formatted references. Find the key of the reference you
are looking for and preface it with an `@`, like the following reference to 
@wickham2010, which creates a text reference. If you surround the key with brackets, you 
instead get a non-text citation [@wickham2010]. If you've done everything right, 
the final document will get a bibliography at the end (as in this one).

## Code Chunks

So far we've only really talked about features that are made possible by pandoc and its
flavor of markdown. But what makes R Markdown special is that is allows us to write code
chunks containing R code. This is a code chunk that plots a simple plot using ggplot2:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(msleep, aes(brainwt, sleep_rem)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "Brain Weight (lbs)", y = "REM Sleep (hours)")
```

As you can see, we've started the code chunk with ` ```{r} ` and ended it with
` ``` `. Everything in between will be treated as R code, just as if you would have
written in in an R script of the R terminal. When you compile this document all
this code will be run and if it produces any output (text, plot, tables) then that
output will make it into the final document.

You can control many settings by changing the parameters in the headline of the
code chunk. In the following chunk we've changed the width and height of the figure as well
as added a caption to the figure. These are settings that will be **incredibly** useful
to you during the course.

```{r fig.cap = "Brain weight and REM sleep duration for mammals.", fig.width = 4, fig.height = 1.5}
ggplot(msleep, aes(brainwt, sleep_rem)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "Brain Weight (kg)", y = "REM Sleep (hours)")
```

## Knitting

When you are done writing content, you can render the final document by *knitting* it.
In RStudio, the shortcut for this is `CTRL+Shift+K`. When a document is knitted, all your
code in the document is first run and then the result is passed on to pandoc, which
produces the final document for you.

R Markdown files can be knitted to a wide range of medium, including
PDF files, HTML, and word documents. Although in this course you will always
produce PDF files from your R Markdown documents.

## Reproducibility

Authoring your documents using R Markdown facilitates reproducibility. Because you
need to supply all the code used to produce your paper in the `.Rmd` file, this
makes it much easier for other people to re-run your analysis and use your code.

# Submissions

In this course, you will use R Markdown for all your assignment submissions. For each
of these you will need to submit both the `.Rmd` source file as well
as the knitted `.pdf` file. Documents from office packages (such as Microsoft Office)
will not be accepted.

# Learning More About R Markdown

If you want to learn more about R Markdown, we recommend the 
[R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-latex.html).
If you run into any issues with R Markdown, please use the course's discussion board on
Canvas or search [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) with the `[r-markdown]` 
or `[knitr]` tag.
