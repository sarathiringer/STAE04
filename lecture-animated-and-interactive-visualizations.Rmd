## Animated Visualizations

offers an extra aesthetic that we can map
variables to: motion

very useful in **presentations**

animating works best when mapping to time or similar process

### gganimate

.pull-left-60[
[gganimate](https://gganimate.com/) is a ggplot-based solution for producing
animations in R

you may need to download and install a
**renderer**; we recommend [gifski](https://gif.ski/)
]

.pull-right-40[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gganimate.svg")
```

]

### Example: Housing Sales in Texas

start with some data

```{r}
# aggregate over years
tx <- select(txhousing, city, year, sales:inventory) %>%
  group_by(city, year) %>%
  summarize_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

.pull-left[
start by building a basic ggplot

```{r houston, eval = FALSE}
p <- tx %>%
  ggplot(aes(median, 
             listings)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
p
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "houston", echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Median sales price and numbers of listings."}
```
]


---

### Animating the Plot

adding `ease_aes()` and `transition_*()` to the plot sets up animation

calling the object invokes the `animate()` function,
which does all the heavy-lifting

.pull-left[
```{r anim1, eval = FALSE}
library(gganimate)

anim <- p +
  transition_time(year) + #<<
  ease_aes() #<<

anim # same as animate(anim)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "anim1", echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
```
]


---

### Labeling

uses special **glue** syntax inside `labs()`

```{r, out.width = "60%"}
anim +
  labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}")
```


---

### Finetuning the Animation

use `animate()` directly for more control over animation

```{r, out.width = "60%", fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
anim2 <- p +
  transition_time(year) +
  labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}")

animate(anim2, duration = 20, nframes = 150) #<<
```

---

## Interactive Visualizations

great for most datasets, particularly complicated datasets, but can
only really be used on webpages

often useful in tandem with carefully designed static visualizations

.pull-left[
### plotly

simple interactive visualizations can be achieved easily using [plotly](https://plotly.com/)

two alternatives: 

- call `plot_ly()` directly
- use `ggplotly()` on a plot built in ggplot2

we focus on the second alternative
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/plotly.png")
```
]

---

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5, eval = FALSE}
library(plotly)
p <- ggplot(msleep, aes(brainwt, sleep_total, color = vore, 
                        genus = genus, 
                        conservation = conservation)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
ggplotly(p) #<<
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "83%"}
knitr::include_graphics("videos/plotly-animation1.gif")
```

---

### Shiny

for more advanced interactive visualizations (beyond the scope of this course), 
have a look at [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("videos/shiny-animation1.gif")
```
